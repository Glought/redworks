Installation:
Craft a floppy. Place it in a drive so it gets a folder created relative to its damage value id. Once you done this, hover the mouse over the disk and look at its id# "floppy disk 4256:1" means that is disk 1 and its path is .minecraft/saves/(yourworldname)/computer/disk/1/ <--
Put the files there. Put the disk in a drive connected to a terminal and reboot if necessary and the setup should autorun :)

The options onscreen are self explanatory.
